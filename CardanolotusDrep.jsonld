    "motivations": "I love Cardano because of its unwavering commitment to core values like scalability, security, and decentralization. Unlike other blockchains that have been influenced by VCs and large corporations, Cardano has maintained its integrity. My goal is to protect and preserve Cardanoâ€™s ethos, support true decentralization, and ensure governance proposals align with its principles. I am also committed to voting for the right projects and innovations to ensure Cardano operates effectively across all aspects.\n",
    "objectives": "I registered as a Drep because I believe every ADA holder has a responsibility to protect and preserve the Cardano blockchain. For on-chain governance to succeed, Cardano needs tens of thousands of Drep to achieve true decentralization. Recognizing that not all ADA holders have the time or capacity to engage deeply with the ecosystem, I am committed to being fully involved, voting on all proposals, and transparently communicating my decisions. Additionally, I will actively share my knowledge of Cardano with the community.\n",
    "qualifications": "I am a passionate Cardano supporter who began exploring the blockchain and ecosystem in March 2024. While I've learned a great deal, I am still eager to deepen my knowledge. I dedicate hours each day to studying Cardano and am committed to continuous learning. Although I currently have no formal qualifications, I am determined to contribute positively to Cardano as a Drep. I am fully committed to analyzing all governance actions and voting accordingly.\n"
